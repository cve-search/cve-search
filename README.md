cve-search
==========

cve-search is a tool to import CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and
CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) into a MongoDB to facilitate search
and processing of CVEs.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3
* MongoDB
* PyMongo
* sax parser (part of Python)

Populating the database
-----------------------

For the initial run, you need to populate the CVE database by running:

    ./db_mgmt.py -p
    ./db_mgmt_cpe_dictionnary.py

It will fetch all the existing XML files from the Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures database and the Common Platform Enumeration.

Updating the database
---------------------

An updater script helps to start the db_mgmt_*  

    ./db_updater.py -v

You can run it in a crontab, logging is done in syslog by default.

Usage
-----

You can search the database using search.py

    ./search.py -p cisco:ios:12.4
    ./search.py -f nagios -n
    ./search.py -p microsoft:windows_7 -o html

If you want to search all the WebEx vulnerabilities and only printing the official
references from the supplier.

    ./search.py -p webex: -o csv  -v "cisco"

Or you can use the XMPP bot

    ./search_xmpp.py -j mybot@jabber.org -p strongpassword

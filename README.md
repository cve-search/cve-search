[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cve-search/cve-search.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cve-search/cve-search)

cve-search is a tool to import CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and
CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) into a MongoDB to facilitate search
and processing of CVEs.

The main objective of the software is to avoid doing direct and public lookups
into the public CVE databases. Local lookups are usually faster and you can 
limit your sensitive queries via the Internet.

cve-search includes a back-end to store vulnerabilities and related information,
an intuitive web interface for search and managing vulnerabilities,
a series of tools to query the system and a web API interface.

cve-search is used by many organizations including the [public CVE services of CIRCL](https://cve.circl.lu/).

This document gives you basic information how to start with cve-search. For more 
information please refer to the documentation in the **_/doc_** folder of this
project.

Requirements
------------

* Python3.3 or later
* MongoDB 2.2 or later
* redis server
* Pip3
  * PyMongo
  * Flask
  * Flask-PyMongo
  * Flask-Login
  * Tornado
  * Whoosh
  * Redis
  * Python-dateutil
  * passlib
  * feedformater (for RSS and Atom dump_last) http://code.google.com/p/feedformatter/
  * Whoosh http://packages.python.org/Whoosh/ (If you're planning to use the Full-text indexer)
  * irc
  * sleekxmpp
  * Werkzeug
  * Jinja2
  * itsdangerous
  * click

The requirements can be installed with pip:

    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Build Docker Image
------------------

First make sure that there is a data folder which contains software_version.json file and cve_data folder. 
* To create the software_versions.json run sbin/db_mgmt.py with -s argument ```python db_mgmt.py -s```
* To create the cve_data folder (which is a backup of processed cve data)
   * run sbin/db_mgmt.py with -j parameter ```python db_mgmt.py -j```
   * back up mongo db with ```mongodump --gzip --archive=path_to/data/cvedb.gz --db cvedb```
   * create docker image with ```ci/push-to-docker-repo.sh```

Installation of MongoDB
-----------------------

First, you'll need to have a Python 3 installation (3.3 or higher).
Then you need to install MongoDB (2.2) from source (this should also work
with any standard packages from your favorite distribution). Don't forget
to install the headers for development while installing MongoDB.
You can go to http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/ for to get the
packages for your distribution, or http://www.mongodb.org/downloads for
the source code.


Populating the database
-----------------------

For the initial run, you need to populate the CVE database by running:

    ./sbin/db_mgmt.py -p
    ./sbin/db_mgmt_cpe_dictionary.py # This will take >45minutes on a decent machine, please be patient
    ./sbin/db_updater.py -c # This will take >45minutes on a decent machine, please be patient

It will fetch all the existing XML files from the Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures database and the Common Platform Enumeration. The initial
Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) import might take some time depending
of your configuration.

If you want to add the cross-references from NIST, Red Hat and other vendors thanks to [VIA4CVE](https://github.com/cve-search/VIA4CVE):

    ./sbin/db_mgmt_ref.py

NB: If you want to  import your own JSON from VIA4CVE, you have to replace URL in sources.ini the VIA4 attribute with `file:///PATH/TO/VIA4CVE/VIA4CVE-feed.json`.

A more detailed documentation can be found in the Documentations folder of the project.

Databases and collections
-------------------------

The MongoDB database is called cvedb and there are 11 collections:

* cves (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure items) - source NVD NIST
* cpe (Common Platform Enumeration items) - source NVD NIST
* cwe (Common Weakness Enumeration items) - source NVD NIST
* capec (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) - source NVD NIST
* ranking (ranking rules per group) - local cve-search
* d2sec (Exploitation reference from D2 Elliot Web Exploitation Framework) - source d2sec.com
* [MITRE Reference Key/Maps](https://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/) - source MITRE reference Key/Maps
* ms - (Microsoft Bulletin (Security Vulnerabilities and Bulletin)) - source [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36982)
* exploitdb (Offensive Security - Exploit Database) - source [offensive security](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database)
* info (metadata of each collection like last-modified) - local cve-search
* via4 [VIA4CVE](https://github.com/cve-search/VIA4CVE) cross-references.

The Redis database has 3 databases:

* 10: The cpe (Common Platform Enumeration) cache - source MongoDB cvedb collection cpe
* 11: The notification database - source cve-search
* 12: The [CVE reference database](https://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/) is a cross-reference database to CVE ids against various vendors ID - source NVD NIST/MITRE

The reference database has 3 additional sources:

* [MITRE Reference Key/Maps](https://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/).
* Red Hat RPM to CVE database.
* Red Hat RHSA Oval database.

Updating the database
---------------------

An updater script helps to start the db_mgmt_*  

    ./sbin/db_updater.py -v

You can run it in a crontab, logging is done in syslog by default.

Repopulating the database
-------------------------

To easily drop and re-populate all the databases

    ./sbin/db_updater.py -v -f

This will drop all the existing external sources and reimport everything. This operation can take some time
and it's usually only required when new attributes parsing are added in cve-search.

Usage
-----

You can search the database using search.py

    ./bin/search.py -p cisco:ios:12.4
    ./bin/search.py -p cisco:ios:12.4 -o json
    ./bin/search.py -f nagios -n
    ./bin/search.py -p microsoft:windows_7 -o html

If you want to search all the WebEx vulnerabilities and only printing the official
references from the supplier.

    ./bin/search.py -p webex: -o csv  -v "cisco"

You can also dump the JSON for a specific CVE ID.

    ./bin/search.py -c CVE-2010-3333

Or you can use the XMPP bot

    ./bin/search_xmpp.py -j mybot@jabber.org -p strongpassword

Or dump the last 2 CVE entries in RSS or Atom format

    ./bin/dump_last.py -f atom -l 2

Or you can use the webinterface.

    ./web/index.py

Usage of the ranking database
-----------------------------

There is a ranking database allowing to rank software vulnerabilities based on
their common platform enumeration name. The ranking can be done per organization
or department within your organization or any meaningful name for you.

As an example, you can add a partial CPE name like "sap:netweaver" which is very
critical for your accounting department.

    ./sbin/db_ranking.py  -c "sap:netweaver" -g "accounting" -r 3

and then you can lookup the ranking (-r option) for a specific CVE-ID:

    ./bin/search.py -c CVE-2012-4341  -r  -n

Advanced usage
--------------

As cve-search is based on a set of tools, it can be used and combined with standard Unix tools. If you ever wonder what are the top vendors using the term "unknown" for their vulnerabilities:

    python3 bin/search_fulltext.py -q unknown -f | jq -c '. | .vulnerable_configuration[0]' | cut -f5 -d: | sort  | uniq -c  | sort -nr | head -10

    1500 oracle
    381 sun
    372 hp
    232 google
    208 ibm
    126 mozilla
    103 microsoft
    100 adobe
     78 apple
     68 linux

You can compare CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System ) values of some products based on their CPE name. Like comparing oracle:java versus sun:jre and using R to make some statistics about their CVSS values:

    python3 bin/search.py -p oracle:java -o json  | jq -r '.cvss' | Rscript -e 'summary(as.numeric(read.table(file("stdin"))[,1]))'
    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
    1.800   5.350   9.300   7.832  10.000  10.000


    python3 bin/search.py -p sun:jre -o json  | jq -r '.cvss' | Rscript -e 'summary(as.numeric(read.table(file("stdin"))[,1]))'
    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
    0.000   5.000   7.500   7.333  10.000  10.000

Fulltext indexing
-----------------

If you want to index all the CVEs from your current MongoDB collection:

    ./sbin/db_fulltext.py -l 0

and you query the fulltext index (to get a list of matching CVE-ID):

    ./bin/search_fulltext.py -q NFS -q Linux

or to query the fulltext index and output the JSON object for each CVE-ID:

    ./bin/search_fulltext.py -q NFS -q Linux -f

Fulltext visualization
----------------------

The fulltext indexer visualization is using the fulltext indexes to build
a list of the most common keywords used in CVE. [NLTK](http://nltk.org/) is
required to generate the keywords with the most common English
stopwords and lemmatize the output. [NTLK for Python 3](http://nltk.org/nltk3-alpha/)
exists but you need to use the alpha version of NLTK.

    ./bin/search_fulltext.py  -g -s >cve.json

![cve-search visualization](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8109/8603509755_c7690c2de4_n.jpg "CVE Keywords Visualization Using Data From cve-search")

You can see a visualization on the [demo site](http://www.foo.be/cve/).

Web interface
-------------

The web interface is a minimal interface to see the last CVE entries and
query a specific CVE. You'll need flask in order to run the website and [Flask-PyMongo](http://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). To start
the web interface:

    cd ./web
    ./index.py

Then you can connect on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to browser the last CVE.

Web API interface
-----------------

The web interface includes a minimal JSON API to get CVE by ID, by vendor or product.
A public version of the API is also accessible on [cve.circl.lu](https://cve.circl.lu/).

cve-search
==========

cve-search is a tool to import CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and
CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) into a MongoDB to facilitate search
and processing of CVEs.

The main objective of the software is to avoid doing direct and public lookup
into the public CVE databases. This is usually faster to do local lookups and
limits your sensitive queries via the Internet.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3
* MongoDB
* PyMongo
* sax parser (part of Python)
* feedformater (for RSS and Atom dump_last) http://code.google.com/p/feedformatter/

If you are planning to use the full-text indexer, you'll need:

* Whoosh http://packages.python.org/Whoosh/

Installation of MongoDB
-----------------------

First, you'll need to have a Python 3 installation (3.2 or 3.3 preferred).
Then you need to install MongoDB (2.2) from source (this should also work
with any standard packages from your favorite distribution). Don't forget
to install the headers for development while installing MongoDB.

Then, you'll need to install PyMongo to access from Python 3 the MongoDB
databases. For installing PyMongo, you can download the source from the
original website https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver .

    python3 setup.py build
    sudo python3 setup.py install

Populating the database
-----------------------

For the initial run, you need to populate the CVE database by running:

    ./db_mgmt.py -p
    ./db_mgmt_cpe_dictionnary.py

It will fetch all the existing XML files from the Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures database and the Common Platform Enumeration.

By default, there is no secondary indexes created in MongoDB for the
CVE/CPE database. You might want to create indexes on the fields that are
commonly used for your searches. As the example, you can create the index
for the following collection and key:

    db.cpe.ensureIndex( {id:1 } )
    db.cves.ensureIndex( {id:1} )
    db.cves.ensureIndex( {vulnerable_configuration:1} )


Database and collections
------------------------

The MongoDB database is called cvedb and there are 4 collections:

* cves (common vulnerabilities and exposure items)
* cpe (common platform enumeration items)
* ranking (ranking rules per group)
* info (metadata of each collection like last-modified)

Updating the database
---------------------

An updater script helps to start the db_mgmt_*  

    ./db_updater.py -v

You can run it in a crontab, logging is done in syslog by default.

Usage
-----

You can search the database using search.py

    ./search.py -p cisco:ios:12.4
    ./search.py -p cisco:ios:12.4 -o json
    ./search.py -f nagios -n
    ./search.py -p microsoft:windows_7 -o html

If you want to search all the WebEx vulnerabilities and only printing the official
references from the supplier.

    ./search.py -p webex: -o csv  -v "cisco"

You can also dump the JSON for a specific CVE ID.

    ./search.py -c CVE-2010-3333

Or you can use the XMPP bot

    ./search_xmpp.py -j mybot@jabber.org -p strongpassword

Or dump the last 2 CVE entries in RSS or Atom format

    ./dump_last.py -f atom -l 2

Usage of the ranking database
-----------------------------

There is a ranking database allowing to rank software vulnerabilities based on
their common platform enumeration name. The ranking can be done per organization
or department within your organization or any meaningful name for you.

As an example, you can add a partial CPE name like "sap:netweaver" which is very
critical for your accounting department.

    ./python3.3 db_ranking.py  -c "sap:netweaver" -g "accounting" -r 3

and then you can lookup the ranking (-r option) for a specific CVE-ID:

    ./python3.3 search.py -c CVE-2012-4341  -r  -n

Fulltext indexing
-----------------

If you want to index all the CVEs from your current MongoDB collection:

    ./python3.3 db_fulltext.py

and you query the fulltext index (to get a list of matching CVE-ID):

    ./python3.3 search_fulltext.py -q NFS -q Linux

or to query the fulltext index and output the JSON object for each CVE-ID:

    ./python3.3 search_fulltext.py -q NFS -q Linux -j

feedformatter 0.5 - Jun 26, 2012

    * Make it work on python 2 and python 3 at the same time
    * warning and code style cleanup

feedformatter 0.4 - XXX Y, 2009

    * Migrated code base to Google code project.

feedformatter 0.3 - March 4, 2008

    * Renamed render_* methods to format_* - makes a bit more sense.
    * Use the standard library ElementTree if it's available, only use an 
      external library if not. In either case, use cElementTree instead of the 
      Python version if available - this should speed things up a bit.
    * Pretty printing is now optional (restoring compatibility with
      Python < 2.0)
    * Atom formatting is now handled in the same way as RSS formatting - no 
      visible changes to the user, just tidier and more manageable code.
    * Slightly more intelligent handling of some Atom components.
    * General code tidy up and website tidy up.

feedformatter 0.2 - March 3, 2008

    * Feeds are now "pretty printed" to their output files, i.e. new lines and 
      indentation are used where appropriate.
    * The fromUFP factory function is now partially working.
    * RSS 2.0 validation has been slightly improved.

feedformatter 0.1 - March 2, 2008

    * The original release.

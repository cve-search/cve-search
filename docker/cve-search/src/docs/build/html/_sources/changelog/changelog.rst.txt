  Fix bug in CPE parsing
- Fix bug in CPE parsing. [mathrock]

  The current CPE dictionary parsing didn't catch the end of the 'title'
  tag and would have extra data in the 'title' attribute of the CPE.

  As an example using CVE-2015-7183 from
  https://cve.circl.lu/api/cve/CVE-2015-7183:

  Currently shows up like this:
      {
        "id": "cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox:41.0.2",
        "title": "Mozilla Firefox 41.0.2\n    \n      Vendor"
      },

  Should be:
      {
        "id": "cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox:41.0.2",

      python3.3 search_fulltext.py -q Java | parallel -j 10 python3.3 search.py -r -c | jq '. | {cvss, summary}'
- JSON output is fixed. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  JSON output is now standard format and using the bson/json conversion.

  You can now use jq to process the results:

          python3.3 search_fulltext.py -q Java -f | jq '.cvss'
- Documentation added for the keywords visualization. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]

  Clarification on the use of NLTK for stemming the keywords and
  how to use it.
- Merge pull request #8 from adulau/master. [Wim Remes]

  Minor bug fixes, Ranking database and keyword analysis
- Output cveid option added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  -o cveid added to output list of the CVE number of
  the matching search.
- Ranking option added for Atom and RSS feeds. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- -j option removed (same as -f) and the cves library is now used.
  [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Avoid MongoDB connection when searches are done in the full-text
  index. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Merge branch 'master' of github.com:adulau/cve-search. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Lemmatize words but also verbs. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Lemmatization and stopwords added to -s in search_fulltext. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]

  Initially I used a stemming algorithm to filter the variation of words.
  But stemming is not appropriate in this case as the use is not to create
  an index out of the terms but to keep the root of the words. Lemmatization is
  more appropriate in this case.

  The option -s is also checking the stopwords corpus from NTLK to remove
  known stopwords from the result.
- A simple stemming function added to the graph output. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Link to visualization added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Visualization added in the README. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Export JSON of the term frequency. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Used for the website visualizing the 2000 most used keywords from
  CVE description. http://www.foo.be/cve/
- Dump terms frequency seen in indexed CVEs. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  -m <n> dump the <n> most frequent terms
  -l dump the lexicons of all the indexed terms from the CVE description.
- Remove ranking based on cpe regexp. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  -d option added to delete the ranking based on their cpe
  name. This can be expressed in any MongoDB regexp.
- Update the db_ranking explanation and display usage. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]

  If the group or the cpe is missing, the usage is now displayed
  with a small explanation of the cve-search ranking.
- Output matching CVE(s) in JSON format. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Method getcve added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Add a reference to Feedformatter 0.5 required. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Feedformatter is required for dump_last in order to dump in RSS
  or Atom format. The lastest version need to be checkout from:

  http://code.google.com/p/feedformatter/

  Because the pip module is not supporting Python version 3.
- Notes about the values to index in MongoDB. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Python 3 interpreter for the indexing process. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Python 3 is now default for launching updaters. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Merge pull request #7 from adulau/master. [Wim Remes]

  Multiple updates
- -i option added to index new CVE entries. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  The db_updater is now calling the indexer to index new entries.
- Add an option to index the last new entries. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  You can now index nth newest entries from CVE:

  %python3.3 db_fulltext.py -l 5 -v
- Add an option to index the last new entries. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  You can now index nth newest entries from CVE:

  %python3.3 db_fulltext.py -l 5 -v
- Doc-id in schema is now unique. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  If you are reindexing from an existing index, you have to
  delete it as the schema changed.
- Update of the index is now supported. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Index presence is checked if it exists. Update document to
  avoid duplicate document in the full-text index. To be used
  for the update process.

  First reference is now properly displayed and seperator is
  consistent for all references.
- Add an option to display only ranked CVE. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Added HTML output and optional CPE lookup. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  The dump_last command now includes in addition to RSS/Atom
  an HTML output generating a table per CVE entry.
- Clarification of the project + a basic installation guide. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Default byte array is now an unicode string. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Basic XML output added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  -o xml is now working when a product/cpe search is done.

  The output format is a minimal XML format containing each matching
  CVE-ID. The format is including the id, references, date of last
  update and the vulnerable configuration if they are present.
- Remove old README confusing with new README.md. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Dump_last usage added to generate RSS or Atom feeds. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Dump last CVE entries in RSS/Atom format. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Arguments are the following:

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
    -f F        Output format (rss1,rss2,atom)
    -l L        Last n items (default:10)

  requires lib/cves.py
- Minimal library to get last CVE from the database. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]

  You can add the ranking and the CPE lookup for each
  element retrieved from the CVE database by default
  rankinglookup and namelookup are disabled.

  A sample code:

      import cves
      l = cves.last(rankinglookup=True)
      l.get()
- A simple CVE database dumper including ranking in JSON. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Print usage if no arguments are used. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Separate ranking lookup from cpe name lookup. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Now the output can include ranking lookup with or without cpe name.
- Skeleton for the RSS/Atom generator. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Remove limit for search results. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Basic explanation for the fulltext indexing. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  db_fulltext.py and search_fulltext.py added in the documentation
  to explain their uses. Be aware that the db_fulltext.py is still
  at the early stage.
- Crude indexer of CVEs to a Whoosh fulltext index. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  The fulltext indexer is relying on Whoosh.

  http://packages.python.org/Whoosh/

  The indexing is done by enumerating all items from
  the MongoDB CVE collection and indexing the summary text of each
  CVE. The Path of each document is the CVE-ID.

  The current indexing is indexing all CVEs from the MongoDB. This need
  to be improved when new items are updated (TODO).

  The fulltext indexing is done to overcome the limitation of MongoDB
  regarding fulltext indexing and to improve response time for non-indexed
  records (especially for the XMPP bot).
- Search interface to the fulltext index (in Whoosh) [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]

  The search interface to query the Whoosh index to find the matching
  CVEs and output the CVE from the MongoDB collection.

  python3.3 search_fulltext.py -q NFS -q Linux
   -> to query NFS and Linux and output the list of matching CVEs

  python3.3 search_fulltext.py -q NFS -q Linux -j
   -> to query NFS and Linux and output the JSON for each CVE
- -l option added to run the fetcher in a loop. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  If you like to run your services in a GNU Screen or a tmux
  session, this allows you to run the updates every hour. without -l
  it's usually for a crontab usage.
- Last-modified check added for CVE and CPE fetch. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  CVE and CPE db_mgmt are now checking the last-modified HTTP header
  to skip the download when the file has been already downloaded.
  A new collection has been created to store the meta information
  (like last-modified) about each collection.

  info collection is like this:

  { "_id" : ObjectId("50ba8d5f597549f61b2a25ab"), "db" : "cve",
  "last-modified" : "Sat, 01 Dec 2012 21:01:07 GMT" }
  { "_id" : ObjectId("50ba8dc4597549f61b2a25ac"), "db" : "cpe",
  "last-modified" : "Sat, 01 Dec 2012 05:12:59 GMT" }

  A list of the collections has been added in the README.
- Merge branch 'master' of github.com:adulau/cve-search. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Cvetweet function added in the XMPP bot. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  cveweet <last> is outputting a text readable output
  of the last CVE entries with the following format:

  CVE-2011-5058 , The CmbWebserver.dll module of the Control service in 3S CoDeSys 3.4 SP4 Patch 2 allows remote attackers to create arbitrary directories under the web root by specifying a non-existent directory using \ (backslash) characters in an HTTP GET request.http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-ALERT-11-336-01A.pdf , http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/72339 , http://secunia.com/advisories/47018 , http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/codesys_1-adv.txt

  CVE-ID, summary, list of references (URLs)
- A small clarification about secondary indexes. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- A full-text "search" query added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  search is a full-text search on the summary field of each CVE items.
  You might consider to have an index on the summary field of the cves collection
  , if you expect to have a lot of queries.

  search <keyword(s)>

  You can search for one or more keywords.
  A small help has been also added to the XMPP bot
- Merge branch 'master' of github.com:adulau/cve-search. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- List ranking to be prepared for other formats. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- CPE lookup is always done for ranking lookup. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Ranking support added in XMPP bot. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  JSON now includes the array ranking (key is ranking).
  If the ranking doesn't exist, the array is empty.
- -l option added to list current rankings. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  List all of the rankings in the ranking collection.
- Merge pull request #5 from adulau/master. [Wim Remes]

  A new ranking functionality added and lookup cpe name added for JSON and text output.
- A ranking functionnality added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Ranking database allows to rank software vulnerabilities based on
  their common platform enumeration name. The ranking can be done
  per organization or department within your organization or any
  meaningful name for you.

  As an example, you can add a partial CPE name like "sap:netweaver"
  which is very critical for your accounting department.

      ./python3.3 db_ranking.py  -c "sap:netweaver" -g "accounting" -r 3

  and then you can lookup the ranking (-r option) for a specific CVE-ID:

      ./python3.3 search.py -c CVE-2012-4341  -r  -n

  The ranking can be extended for notification in the XMPP search bot
  or alike.

  The ranking collection is a new collection in the MongoDB database.

  With the following format (a sample record):

     { "_id" : ObjectId("50b2081e597549f61b2a25a7"), "cpe" : "sap:netweaver", "rank" : [ { "accounting" : 3 } ] }
- Lookup cpe name for text output in product search. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Merge branch 'master' of git://github.com/wimremes/cve-search.
  [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Merge pull request #4 from adulau/master. [Wim Remes]

  Show vendor references only
- Lookup cpe name for JSON output in product search. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Search and show vendor references only in CSV output. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]

  Usually you just want to have the references from the vendor to
  a specific vulnerability and you don't want the full references.

  The -v option allows to search in the hostname of the references
  for a specific vendor. Yep, we assume that a vendor got his own
  domain name (it's usually the case ;-).

    ./search.py -p webex: -o csv  -v "cisco"

  The following example allows you to search webex products and
  show only the vendor links.
- Merge branch 'master' of git://github.com/wimremes/cve-search.
  [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Merge pull request #3 from adulau/master. [Wim Remes]

  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) added
- URLs fixed. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- New README in markdown format. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Search CVE XMPP Bot added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Simple XMPP bot to query for the last entries in the CVE database
  and to get the output in JSON format. Useful for dynamic application
  requiring a constant feed of updates.

  Current command supported is: last <max>

  To get the n last entries from the CVE database.

  The sleekxmpp library is required.
- Merge branch 'master' of github.com:adulau/cve-search. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]
- Updater script to start db_ scripts and logging. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  script that can be used in cron or alike to automatically
  start the db_ updater script and logging the # of updates done.
- -v option added - verbose messages are now optional. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]

  logging is now optional
- -n added to lookup Common Platform Enumeration. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  This option replaces cpe name with human-readable description
  of the common platform name. You need to have the cpe collection
  imported via db_mgmt_cpe_dictionnary.py.

  If there is no human-readable description available, the original
  cpe name is used.

  As an example, you can now search with CPE resolution enabled:

  search.py -c CVE-2012-2897 -n

  and without:

  search.py -c CVE-2012-2897
- Importing Common Platform Enumeration into cvedb. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  This script is fetching the official Common Platform Enumeration[1]
  into the cve database as a standalone collection. The collection
  format is composed of an id which is the cpe name and the title
  which is the human readable name.
- Merge pull request #2 from adulau/master. [Wim Remes]

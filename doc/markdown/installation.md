# Installation Guide - Linux
## Installation procedure for CVE-Search on Linux
This page describes the installation procedure for CVE-Search on Linux.
This installation procedure is written for Ubuntu, but will work on most
 other distributions. In this guide, we assume you are using *apt* as
 your package manager. If you are using a different one, install the
 requirements using your package manager of choice

## Requirements
In order to install CVE-Search, you will need approximately 3 to 4GB of
 free disk space, as well as root or administrator access to the machine
 you want to install it on. There is no minimum requirements regarding
 CPU or memory, but slower systems will have a longer load time.

**CVE-Search requires the packages you find below in order to function.**

| Package      | Installation                      |
| :---         | :--                               |
| Python3      | sudo apt-get install python3      |
| MongoDB      | sudo apt-get install mongodb      |
| Redis Server | sudo apt-get install redis-server |
| PIP3         | sudo apt-get install python3-pip  |

After installing these packages, you need to install some python modules
 using PIP3. These modules are all in the requirements.txt file, and can
 be easily installed using *sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt*

 * PyMongo
 * Flask
 * Flask-pymongo
 * Flask-login
 * Tornado
 * Whoosh
 * Redis
 * Python-dateutil
 * Passlib
 * [Feedformatter](https://github.com/marianoguerra/feedformatter/archive/master.zip)
 * irc
 * sleekxmpp
 * Werkzeug
 * Jinja2
 * itsdangerous
 * click

## Configuration
Cve-search can be conigured using 3 different ways:
1. using defaut settings, only if all components (mongo, redis, and cve-search) are located on localhost.
2. By configuration file (configuration.ini)
3. By using environment variables (SEARCHCVE_nameofvariables)

Variables can be find inside of lib/Config.py


## CVE-Search can creted from 2 different ways

### Setting up CVE-Search from Docker containers

Before setting up CVE-Search, you have to make sure the scripts are
 present on your system. Then is needed to create clone from master repository.


 * git clone https://github.com/dsever/cve-search.git



To build docker container run:
 *  docker-compose build

As optimisation docker will create two containers, one for compiling python libraries and other where it will copy compiled libs.

Create folder that will keep static mongo files:

 * mkdir -p ../data/mongo

OR change its path in docker-compose file


After succesful bilidng of containers we can run CVE-search like:

 * docker-compose up


Default username and password can be set using environment variables (both values need to be created):
 * SEARCHCVE_DEFAULTUSER
 * SEARCHCVE_DEFAULTUSERPWD (pbkdf2 sha256)

hash rounds = 8000
salt_size = 10



### Setting up CVE-Search from source code
Before setting up CVE-Search, you have to make sure the scripts are
 present on your system. Your best choice is to use *git* to clone
 CVE-Search from github.

You can clone either of the git projects found below

 * git clone https://github.com/PidgeyL/cve-search.git
 * git clone https://github.com/adulau/cve-search.git
 * git clone https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search.git

Other sources are available, but most of them are either outdated or
 experimental.

Alternatively, you can download the project by downloading the zip file
 and extracting it. You can get the zip file from the following places:

  * [PidgeyLs fork](https://github.com/PidgeyL/cve-search/archive/master.zip)
  * [Alexandre Dulaunoys fork](https://github.com/adulau/cve-search/archive/master.zip)
  * [The offical CVE-Search Project, based of Wim Remes work](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search/archive/master.zip)

The initial setup of CVE-Search happens only once, at the installation.
This consists of three steps and one optional step.

 * Populating the database
 * Creating the CVE dictionary
 * *Optional:* You can also run the "Other CVE Dictionary" script to help fill in the blanks
 * Updating the database

#### Populating the database
Populating the database might take a while when you first run the script.
Before you run this script, there are two important parameters you need
 to set in your configuration.ini file.

These settings can be found under the [CVE] section. These settings are:

| Setting   | Default setting | Explanation |
| :---      | :---            | :---        |
| StartYear | 2002            | The start year of CVE you want in your database. The lowest setting is 2002, the highest is the current year. |

Once you checked these settings, verify that the settings in the [Mongo]
 section are the connection settings for your database.
If you installed the database with the default settings, these settings
 should be fine. The table below explains these settings a bit more:

| Setting | Default setting | Explanation |
| :---    | :---            | :---        |
| Host    | localhost       | The host the Mongo database server is running on |
| Port    | 27017           | The port that Mongo uses on the host specified above |
| DB      | cvedb           | The database CVE-Search will save its information to. Changing this is a good way to do some testing, without having to restore the entire database afterwards |

Once you checked these settings, you can run the script by either typing
 `./db_mgmt.py -p` or `python3 db_mgmt.py -p`. You will see the message
 "Database population started".
If you want more output of what the script does, while it's running, you
 can add the parameter `-v` to any of these commands.

#### Creating the CVE dictionary
This script fills the database with the product information. This
 information one of the key features of cve-search, as this allows you
 to search for vulnerabilities for specific systems, and allows you to
 see to what systems a CVE applies.
It also allows for a user-friendly, readable format for the CPE. This
 script will translate CVE formats like
 `cpe:/a:adobe:flash_player:14.0.0.125` to readable formats like
 `Adobe Flash Player 14.0.0.125 APSB14-16` where possible.

To run this script, either type `./db_mgmt_cpe_dictionary.py` or
 `python3 db_mgmt_cpe_dictionary.py`.

This script uses the CVE dictionary from NIST's NVD. As there are a lot
 of products, they can not make a title for each CVE manually. That's
 why CVE-Search has another script, called `db_mgmt_cpe_other_dictionary.py`
This script takes the CVEs that have no title, and splits them into a
 human readable format.

To add this dictionary, type `python3 db_mgmt_cpe_other_dictionary.py`
 and hit enter.

**NOTE:** It is possible this script will crash, due to the large amount of
 information. If this happens, first run `python3 db_mgmt_create_index.py`


#### Updating the database
Before updating the database, you have to decide if you will use the web
 interface of CVE-Search. This interface uses Redis Cache to speed up
 CVE browsing. If you will be using this feature, make sure your
 configuration.ini file has the correct settings, and points to your
 Redis server. The table below explains the several settings.

| Setting         | Default setting | Explanation |
| :---            | :---            | :---        |
| Host            | localhost       | The host the Redis database server is running on |
| Port            | 6379            | The port that Redis uses on the host specified above |
| VendorsDB       | 10              | The Redis database to store vendor information |
| NotificationsDB | 11              | The Redis database to store notifications |

Finally, update the database by typing `python3 db_updater.py` or
 `python3 db_updater.py` and hit enter.
If you are planning on using the web interface, it is recommended to add
 parameter `-c`

If you are planning on using the fulltext indexer, it is recommended to
 add parameter `-i`
To add verbose output, add parameter `-v`
To let the script run automatically at a regular interval, add parameter
 `-l`

**NOTE:** The updating script may warn you that the plug-in file is missing.
 This can be resolved by creating `./etc/plugins.txt`. However, if the file
 is missing, the update still works.

### Fulltext Search
If you want to enable fulltext search, you have to enable this in the
 database. <br />
To do this, log into the Mongo database (`$ mongo`) and run the following
 command: `db.adminCommand({"setParameter": 1, "textSearchEnabled":true})`.

**Note:** when the Mongo database is shut down, fulltext search will be
 disabled again. Simply run the same command again to activate it.

## Final notes
After this procedure the database is initialized and up to date. From
 this point on, to update the database, you only have to repeat the
 procedure to update the database.

If you decided not to the optional step, you can still initialize this
 later on.
